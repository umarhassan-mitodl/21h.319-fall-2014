description: Thumbnail of a photo of protesters on a highway overpass with a lit up
  sign that reads "#FERGUSON". The fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year old
  black teenager, by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri sparked protests
  and civil unrest in the U.S. and abroad in 2014-2015. This course aims to help students
  understand how American criminal justice arrived at its current troubled state,
  and what can be done to change it. (Image courtesy of Light Brigading on flickr.
