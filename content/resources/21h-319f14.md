description: Protesters stand on a highway overpass with a lit up sign that reads
  "#FERGUSON". The fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year old black teenager,
  by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri sparked protests and civil unrest
  in the U.S. and abroad in 2014-2015. This course aims to help students understand
  how American criminal justice arrived at its current troubled state, and what can
  be done to change it. (Image courtesy of Light Brigading on flickr. License CC BY-NC.)
